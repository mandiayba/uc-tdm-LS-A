# uc-tdm-LS-A

This repository is for the development of the ChEBI curation application.

The web interface to the application can be found at: http://nactem.ac.uk/apps/openminted/chebi/

Currently, we have documentation for the application in this repository. This can be accessed at: https://builds.openminted.eu/job/uc-tdm-LS-A/ws/Documentation/target/generated-docs/intro.html

The workflow underlying this application uses the Argo text-mining workbench. See http://argo.nactem.ac.uk/ for more.
