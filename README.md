This repository is for the development of the ChEBI curation application.

The web interface to the application can be found at: http://nactem.ac.uk/apps/openminted/chebi/

Currently, we have documentation for the application in this repository.

The workflow underlying this application uses the Argo text-mining workbench. See http://argo.nactem.ac.uk/ for more.
